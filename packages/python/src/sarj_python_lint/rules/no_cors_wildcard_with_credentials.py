"""SARJ028: detect Starlette/FastAPI CORS that echoes any Origin with credentials.

`CORSMiddleware(allow_credentials=True, allow_origins=[..., "*", ...])` tells the
browser to reflect the request's `Origin` back in
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` AND to send `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:
true`. Together these let *any* website read authenticated (cookie/session)
responses — a cross-origin credential-theft surface.

The rule fires on an `ast.Call` that has BOTH `allow_credentials=True`
(literal) AND an `allow_origins` value whose subtree contains a `"*"` string
literal anywhere — so it catches the bare `["*"]` form as well as the
`allowed if flag else ["*"]` conditional branch. The keyword pair is unique to
Starlette's CORSMiddleware, so matching the callee name is unnecessary (though it
would be a valid further tightening).
