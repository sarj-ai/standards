"""SARJ003: flag `if/elif isinstance(...)` chains that dispatch over a *local* closed union.

A chain of `if isinstance(x, A): ... elif isinstance(x, B): ... else: raise` where every
`A`, `B`, ... is a class **defined in this same module** and the chain terminates
exhaustively is dispatch over a locally-owned discriminated union. `match`/`case` with
`assert_never` in the fallthrough is strictly better: pyright reports an error the moment a
new variant is added and a branch is missed — a plain `isinstance` chain silently falls
through.

    # flagged
    class ApiKeySubject: ...
    class JwtSubject: ...

    if isinstance(subject, ApiKeySubject):
        ...
    elif isinstance(subject, JwtSubject):
        ...
    else:
        assert_never(subject)

    # preferred
    match subject:
        case ApiKeySubject():
            ...
        case JwtSubject():
            ...
        case _:
            assert_never(subject)

The rule fires ONLY when both gates hold, because only then is a mechanical rewrite to an
exhaustive `match` both correct and beneficial:

1. **Local-union gate.** Every `isinstance` arm tests a bare `ast.Name` that resolves to an
   `ast.ClassDef` in this module — not an imported name, not a dotted `pkg.Cls`, not a
   builtin/stdlib type. Probing open-set types the module does not own
   (`property`, `cached_property`, `Path`, `Decimal`, `dataclasses.Field`, ...) is a
   legitimate runtime check, not closed-union dispatch, and is never flagged.
2. **Exhaustiveness gate.** The chain ends in a terminal `else`/final branch that raises,
   returns, asserts, or calls an `assert_never`-style helper. An *open* chain — no `else`,
   or a permissive `else` that silently falls through — is not equivalent to an exhaustive
   `match` and must not be flagged, since converting it would change behavior.

This is still a heuristic (a locally-defined class could be re-exported, an imported class
could be the real union member). Suppress a deliberate boundary chain with
`# sarj-noqa: SARJ003 — <reason>`.
