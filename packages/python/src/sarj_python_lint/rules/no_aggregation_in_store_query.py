"""SARJ020: no DISTINCT / GROUP BY / COUNT in a store query — aggregate elsewhere.

Heavy aggregation (`COUNT`, `GROUP BY`, `DISTINCT`) does not belong in the
transactional Postgres store layer: it scans, sorts, and hashes large row sets
on the primary, competing with the latency-critical OLTP path. The house
direction is to push aggregate/analytical reads to the columnar mirror
(ClickHouse / BigQuery), where they are cheap, and keep Postgres queries to
point lookups and small bounded reads.

This rule walks SQL string literals embedded in `.py` (`*_store.py`) and flags
any query (a string containing `FROM`) that uses `COUNT(`, `GROUP BY`, or
`DISTINCT`. SQL string-literal values and `--` / `/* */` comments are neutralized
first, so an aggregate keyword or a backtick living inside a quoted value never
affects the result.

    # flagged
    "SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM call GROUP BY status"
    "SELECT DISTINCT org_id FROM call"

    # preferred
    point/bounded reads in Postgres; aggregate in ClickHouse/BigQuery.

Queries against the columnar mirrors are exempt: a file importing the ClickHouse
SDK, or a single query using ClickHouse-only functions or BigQuery syntax
(backtick-quoted table identifiers, BQ-only functions), is not a Postgres store
query and is out of scope. A file-level BigQuery-SDK import exempts only queries
that carry no Postgres-specific signal — a psycopg `%s` placeholder marks a real
Postgres store query even in a mixed analytics module.

If an aggregate genuinely must run on Postgres (e.g. a tiny bounded admin
count), suppress with `# sarj-noqa: SARJ020 — <reason>`.
