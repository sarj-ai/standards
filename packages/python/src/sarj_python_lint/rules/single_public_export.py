"""SARJ022: rename a junk-drawer module stem with a single public export.

Such a module stem should describe its responsibility instead.

This rule is deliberately narrow. It fires ONLY when BOTH hold:

  (a) the module stem is a generic "junk-drawer" name that says nothing about
      the module's responsibility (`utils`, `base`, `models`, `types`, ...), AND
  (b) the module has exactly one public top-level `def` / `class`, so the
      rename target is unambiguous.

When both hold, the sole public export's name is the obvious, information-rich
replacement for the meaningless stem (`utils.py` exposing `snake_case_text` ->
`snake_case_text.py`; `enums.py` exposing `IntegrationProvider` ->
`integration_provider.py`).

Why the denylist gate matters: an informative stem names the module's DOMAIN
(`pagination.py`, `retry_wrapper.py`, `warmup.py`), which is frequently broader
than its one current export. Renaming those to the export loses the domain and
is a regression. A junk-drawer stem carries no domain to lose, so replacing it
with the export name is strictly an improvement.

Public = a top-level `class` / `def` / `async def` whose name has no leading
underscore. Constants (assignments), `__all__`, and imports are ignored.

Skipped entirely: `__init__.py`, `conftest.py`, test files (`test_*.py` or under
a `tests/` directory), and framework-convention filenames whose stem is fixed by
a framework/tool and cannot be renamed (`models.py`, `views.py`, `base.py`, ...).
Modules whose single export already snake-cases to the stem are not flagged
(there is nothing to improve).
