"""SARJ019: a SQL query with 3+ JOINs is too entangled — split or denormalize.

Three years of store reviews repeatedly push back on multi-table joins inside a
single store query ("can we remove the joins?", "do the join at the application
layer", "whenever I see a join my ears perk up"). A query fanning across many
tables couples models that should stay separate, is hard to index well, and
usually wants either denormalization or splitting into per-store reads joined in
application code.

This rule walks SQL string literals embedded in `.py` (the raw queries in
`*_store.py`) and flags any single query string containing **3 or more** `JOIN`
keywords. `LEFT/RIGHT/INNER/FULL/CROSS JOIN` each count as one. SQL string-literal
values and `--` / `/* */` comments are neutralized first, so a `'join'` value or
a `--` inside a quoted value never affects the count. Only strings that actually
look like a query (they contain a `FROM`) are considered, keeping false positives
low.

If a join-heavy read is genuinely the right call, suppress with
`# sarj-noqa: SARJ019 — <reason>`.
