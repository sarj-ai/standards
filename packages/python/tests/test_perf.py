"""Performance regression test.

Two guards, both run over a large synthetic Python file:

* an absolute backstop — no rule may blow a generous ms/1k-LOC ceiling, catching a
  catastrophic slowdown regardless of hardware;
* a relative outlier gate — no single rule may take more than 10x the median rule
  time. This is hardware-independent and is what catches an algorithmic regression
  (e.g. a rule going quadratic) that an absolute, machine-dependent budget would miss
  on a fast laptop but hit on slow CI. SARJ001 was exactly such an outlier (~30x the
  next-slowest rule) before it was rewritten; this gate is what pins that down.

The documented target is < 50 ms / 1k LOC per rule; the relative gate enforces it in
spirit without flaking across machines.
