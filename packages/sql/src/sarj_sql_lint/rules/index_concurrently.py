"""SARJ108: `CREATE INDEX` must use `CONCURRENTLY`.

A plain `CREATE INDEX` takes an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`-ish lock that blocks all writes
to the table for the full build — on a large production table that is an outage.
`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` builds without blocking writes. (It cannot run inside a
transaction block, so such migrations must be marked non-transactional.)
